> #### What's the differences between helpers and utils?
>
> - **/utils** - is a place where you can place small snippets you can use throughout the application.
> Small functions to build bigger things with.
>
> - **/helpers** - is more of a place where you store code architectural snippets in my view.
> Things essential for bootstrapping components and developer ergonomics.
